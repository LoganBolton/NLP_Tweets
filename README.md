# Kaggle Twitter disaster prediction competition

## Submission #1
- 3 Epochs
- No location data was included in the training data
- Score: 0.82102
    - Pretty solid score

## Submission #2
- 10 Epochs
- Uses location data
- Score: 0.83113
    - Not as high as I hoped
    - Likely due to faulty data in training

## Submission #3
- 10 Epochs

## Ideas for improvement
- use the bert-base-cased model instead
    - Upper case could be meaningful data
- Clean up the data
    - According to the discussion, there are some data entries that are duplicated with bad labels
